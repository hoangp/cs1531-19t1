# Step 1: Write an empty method
def calculate_simple_interest(principal,interest,years):
    return principal*interest*years

# Step 2: Write a test (that fails) for the above method and run the test
# Step 3: Write just enough code to make the above test succeed
# Step 4: Re-run the test and ensure that the test succeeds
# Step 5: Repeat the above steps
