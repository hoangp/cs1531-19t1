# Step 2: Write a test (that fails) for the above method and run the test
#def  test_calculate_simple_interest():
#	assert calculate_simple_interest(100,0.04,1) ==  4


# Step 3: Write just enough code to make the above test succeed
# Step 4: Re-run the test and ensure that the test succeeds
# Step 5: Repeat the above steps
